# February 10th, 2026
## Agenda
  * MS dataset (already exists in server)
    * Dataset is massive (will take a long time to process)
    * Will need to recreate manifest and metadata without the rrms patients
    * Sample size concern (might be too small) with certain treatments

## Discussion
1. 

## Conclusions
* Collectively decided on MS dataset, looking into treatment differences in severe MS patients (SPMS and PPMS)

## To-do
1. For data processing:
- [ ] In R, before importing the data, first sort the MS dataset from the server and copy it into our folder (keep it in .tsv file format)
- [ ] Then match the sorted sample IDs to filter for the same samples in the manifest file
2. For project 2 proposal:
- [ ] Make sure to mention and describe the different stages of MS and why we are only focusing on the 2
- [ ] Talk about what previous literature has shown on significance of treatment results
