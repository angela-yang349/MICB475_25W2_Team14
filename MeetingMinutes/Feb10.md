# February 10th, 2026
## Agenda
  * Completed work:
    * Filtered metadata and manifest files to remove RRMS patients
    * Ran QIIME2 pipeline on filtered data and generated table.qzv and rep-seq.qzv
  * Upcoming work:
    * Diversity metrics
      * Keep SPMS and PPMS separate then look at different treatments within each group vs. non-treated
      * Could bin treatments that have the same significance
    * Team proposal 
  * Questions:
    * How should we determine sampling depth?
    * Team proposal

## Discussion
1. Proposal Tips From Ritu
* Title of proposal should start with -ing word
* Mention previous papers
* Talk about the different types of MS (RRMS, PPMS)
* Research question section, put question in bold and mention hypothesis
 * Hypothesis should be based on previous papers and in a formal tone
* Aims should be titled like a sentence (not just “diversity analysis”)
* Mention which statistic tests we are using in the table for the proposal
* Key: look at example proposals as a guideline
2. Currently
* In process of picking sampling depth → 55
* table.qzv and rep-seq.qzv are in the repository
* Quality of sequences is good, no trimming
* Working on rarefraction part
3. Meeting During Reading Break?
* Either a Zoom meeting later in the week or we email Ritu questions from our own separate meeting
4. To Do
* Taxonomy classification
